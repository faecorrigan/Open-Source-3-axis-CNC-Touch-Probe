recorded several single_press then long_press events. Sometimes recordings were back to back, and sometimes there was time (and perhaps incidental press events?) in between

Reviewing the data, it looks like the first packet sent after a press has bits that pertain to the previous press, so I now want to collect many-event recordings so I'm certain I'm not missing any data in between
